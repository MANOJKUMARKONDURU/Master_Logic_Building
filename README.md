# Master Logic Building

## Phase 1 - Conditional Thinking (if-else, Boolean Logic)
🎯Goal: Understand how to make decisions using conditions.

Topics covered: Relational operators, logical operators, nested if, multiple conditions.

**Target Questions: 50**

🟢 Level 1: Simple Conditions (Getting started)
1. Take a number and print whether it’s positive, negative, or zero.
2. Check if a number is even or odd.
3. Check if a number is divisible by 5.
4. Check if a number is divisible by both 3 and 5.
5. Check if a given year is a leap year.
6. Take two numbers and print the larger one.
7. Take three numbers and print the largest.
8. Take a temperature value and print “Cold”
9. Take a character and check if it’s a vowel or consonant.

2. If the sides form a valid triangle, determine whether it is equilateral, isosceles, or
3. Take marks (0–100) and print the corresponding grade (A/B/C/D/F).
4. Check if one of two given numbers is a multiple of the other.
5. Take the hour of the day (0–23) and print “Good Morning”
,
“Good Afternoon”
,
“Good
Evening”
, or “Good Night”
.
6. Check voting eligibility for a given age (18+).
7. Take two numbers and determine whether both are even, both are odd, or one is
even and one is odd.
8. Take an alphabet character and check if it lies between ‘a’ and ‘m’ or ‘n’ and ‘z’
.
9. Take a day number (1–7) and print the corresponding day name.
10. Take a month number (1–12) and print the number of days in that month (ignore leap
years).

🟠 Level 3: Math and Number Logic
1. Take a 3-digit number and check if all digits are distinct.
2. Take a 3-digit number and determine if the middle digit is the largest, smallest, or
neither.
3. Take a 4-digit number and check if the first and last digits are equal.
4. Check whether a given integer is single-digit, double-digit, or multi-digit.
5. Check if a number is a multiple of 7 or ends with 7.
6. Take coordinates (x, y) and determine which quadrant the point lies in.
7. Check if an amount can be evenly divided into 2000, 500, and 100 currency notes.
8. Check if a number lies within the range [100, 999].
9. Take two angles of a triangle and compute the third angle.
10. Check whether a number is a perfect square (without using the square root function).

🟢 Level 4: Logical Operators & Compound Statements
1. Take a character and check if it is a letter, a digit, or neither.
2. Take a number and print “Fizz” if divisible by 3,
“FizzBuzz” if divisible by both.
3. Take three numbers and print the median value (neither maximum nor minimum).
4. Take 24-hour time (hours and minutes) and print whether it is AM or PM.
5. Take income and age, and check if eligible for tax (age > 18 and income > 5 L).
6. Take two numbers and check if both are positive and their sum is less than 100.
7. Take a single digit (0–9) and print its word form (“Zero” to “Nine”).
8. Take a weekday number (1–7) and determine if it is a weekday or weekend.

1. Take coordinates (x, y) and check if the point lies on the X-axis, Y-axis, or at the
2. Take three numbers and check if they can form a Pythagorean triplet.
3. Take day and month and check if it forms a valid calendar date (ignoring leap years).
4. Take time (hours and minutes) and print the smaller angle between the hour and
minute hands.
5. Take three numbers and check if they are in arithmetic progression.
6. Take three numbers and check if they are in geometric progression.
7. Take a 3-digit number and check if the sum of the first and last digit equals the middle
digit.
8. Take an integer (1–9999) and check if the sum of its digits is greater than the product
of its digits.
9. Take two dates (day and month) and determine which one comes first in the
calendar.
10. Take a year and print the corresponding century (e.g.,
“19th century”
,
“20th century”)
